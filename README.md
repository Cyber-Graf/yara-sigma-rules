🧬 Cyber Graf — YARA & SIGMA Rules

This repository contains custom detection rules developed by the [Cyber Graf](https://t.me/cyber_graf) project. 
These rules focus on real-world threats, misconfigurations, and offensive techniques seen in malware, cloud, identity systems, and advanced adversary behavior.

## Quality Policy

- ✅ MITRE ATT&CK tags  
- ✅ Custom UUIDs per rule  
- ✅ Minimal false positives, context-aware  
- ✅ Fully documented meta fields  
- ⚠️ `experimental` status until confirmed in production
